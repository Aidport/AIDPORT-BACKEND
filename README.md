## Tech Stack

- **NestJS** – Backend framework
- **MongoDB** – Database (via Mongoose)
- **Argon2** – Password hashing
- **JWT** – Authentication
- **Passport** – Auth strategy
- **class-validator** – DTO validation
- **Cloudinary + Multer** – File uploads

## Setup

1. Copy env file and configure:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Ensure MongoDB is running (or use the default `mongodb://localhost:27017/aidport`).

4. Configure Cloudinary (for file uploads): Set `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` in `.env`.

5. Start the app:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```
